! Program to calculate the PL/CPL spectra of chiral aggregate using the Holstein Hamiltonian
! 2D coupling will be incorporated via the methods of R Ghosh
! Problem is to build the Hamiltonian of a system representing a chiral stack of conjugated polymers
! Use the theory developed by F Spano to calculate TDs of each chromophore
! - Two particle basis set
